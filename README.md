# Understanding and visualizing PyTorch Batching with LSTM

This is a small notebook that I wrote to help me understand how batching was done in PyTorch with an Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM).

Please, if you see anything wrong within this notebook feel free to contribute or submit an issue, I may have misunderstood/misinterpreted/misrepresented some things here.

The point here wasn't to build a state of the art model but visualize properly how PyTorch handle the tensors while batching them into an LSTM.

Thanks to [Tushar-N](https://gist.github.com/Tushar-N/dfca335e370a2bc3bc79876e6270099e) from which I inspired this repo and of cours the [Classifying Names with a Character-Level RNN](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html) PyTorch tutorial.
